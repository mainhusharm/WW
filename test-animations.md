# Animation Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Missing Tailwind Animation Definitions**: Added all missing animations to `tailwind.config.js`
2. **CSS Animation Class Conflicts**: Updated `src/index.css` to use Tailwind classes properly
3. **Performance Mode Logic**: Made performance detection less aggressive
4. **Reduced Motion Detection**: Added proper `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support
5. **Animation Dependencies**: Ensured all animation classes are properly defined

## How to Test:

1. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Visit the animation test page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/animation-test
   ```

3. **Check the main landing page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/
   ```

## Expected Results:

### Animation Test Page (`/animation-test`):
- All basic animations should work immediately on page load
- Scroll animations should trigger when scrolling
- Hover effects should work on interactive elements

### Landing Page (`/`):
- Hero section should have fade-in and slide-up animations
- Stats cards should animate in with staggered timing
- Features and process sections should animate on scroll
- 3D hover effects should work on cards

## If Animations Still Don't Work:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify CSS Loading**: Ensure `index.css` and `3d-animations.css` are loaded
3. **Check Tailwind Build**: Ensure Tailwind is properly building with new animations
4. **Performance Mode**: Check if performance mode is enabled (look for toggle button)

## Common Issues and Solutions:

### Issue: "animate-fade-in is not defined"
**Solution**: Restart your development server after updating `tailwind.config.js`

### Issue: "CSS animations not working"
**Solution**: Check if CSS files are properly imported in `main.tsx`

### Issue: "Only some animations work"
**Solution**: Verify that all animation classes are properly defined in Tailwind config

### Issue: "Scroll animations not triggering"
**Solution**: Check if Intersection Observer is supported in your browser

## Performance Toggle:

The landing page has a performance toggle button (top-right) that allows you to:
- Enable/disable animations for testing
- Bypass performance detection
- Force animations to work

## Browser Compatibility:

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Mobile**: Reduced animations for performance

## Next Steps:

1. Test the animation test page first
2. If that works, test the main landing page
3. Report any specific errors you see
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## Files Modified:

- `tailwind.config.js` - Added all animation definitions
- `src/index.css` - Updated to use Tailwind classes
- `src/components/LandingPage.tsx` - Fixed animation logic
- `src/components/AnimationTest.tsx` - Created test component
- `src/App.tsx` - Added test route
