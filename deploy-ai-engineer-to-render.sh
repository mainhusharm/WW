# AI Engineer System - Deployment Summary

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT COMPLETED**

The AI Engineer system has been successfully prepared for Render deployment.

## üì¶ **NEW FILES ADDED**

### Production APIs
- `api-server/live-system-metrics-api-production.js` - Real-time system monitoring
- `api-server/emergency-notification-api-production.js` - Emergency alerts and notifications
- `api-server/ai-customer-care-engineer-production.js` - Customer support automation

### Configuration Files
- `render-production.env` - Production environment variables
- `ai-engineer-config.js` - Centralized configuration
- `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment guide

### Scripts
- `deploy-ai-engineer-to-render.sh` - This deployment script
- `activate-ai-engineer.sh` - Local activation script
- `deactivate-ai-engineer.sh` - Local deactivation script
- `set-env-vars.sh` - Environment variable setup

## üîß **NEXT STEPS FOR RENDER DEPLOYMENT**

### 1. Create New Services in Render

#### Live System Metrics API
- **Name**: `ai-live-metrics-api`
- **Runtime**: Node
- **Start Command**: `node api-server/live-system-metrics-api-production.js`
- **Environment Variables**: Copy from `render-production.env`

#### Emergency Notification API
- **Name**: `ai-emergency-notification-api`
- **Runtime**: Node
- **Start Command**: `node api-server/emergency-notification-api-production.js`
- **Environment Variables**: Copy from `render-production.env`

#### AI Customer Care API
- **Name**: `ai-customer-care-api`
- **Runtime**: Node
- **Start Command**: `node api-server/ai-customer-care-engineer-production.js`
- **Environment Variables**: Copy from `render-production.env`

### 2. Update Existing Frontend Service

Add all environment variables from `render-production.env` to your existing Frontend service.

### 3. Test Deployment

After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `https://ai-live-metrics-api.onrender.com/health`
- `https://ai-emergency-notification-api.onrender.com/health`
- `https://ai-customer-care-api.onrender.com/health`

### 4. Access Dashboards

- **Live Emergency Monitoring**: `https://your-frontend.onrender.com/live-emergency-monitoring`
- **AI Assistant Dashboard**: `https://your-frontend.onrender.com/ai-assistant-dashboard`
- **Help & Contact**: `https://your-frontend.onrender.com/help-contact`
