# ðŸš¨ QUICK FIX FOR DATA NOT SAVING

## Run This Debug Script First
```bash
pip3 install requests psycopg2-binary
python3 debug_backend_issue.py
```

This will tell us exactly what's wrong.

## Most Likely Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Database Tables Don't Exist
**Symptoms:** Debug script shows "Required tables not found"
**Fix:**
```bash
python3 apply_database_schema.py
```

### Issue 2: Old Backend Still Deployed
**Symptoms:** Debug script shows no endpoint information or old version
**Fix:** Deploy the new backend to Render:

1. **Go to your Render dashboard**
2. **Find your backend service** (backend-topb)
3. **Replace your main backend file** with `backend_routes_for_render.py`
4. **Update requirements.txt** to include:
   ```
   Flask==2.3.3
   Flask-CORS==4.0.0
   psycopg2-binary==2.9.7
   gunicorn==21.2.0
   ```
5. **Set start command** to: `gunicorn backend_routes_for_render:app`
6. **Deploy**

### Issue 3: Backend Endpoints Return 404
**Symptoms:** Debug script shows 404 errors for `/api/auth/register` etc.
**Fix:** The new backend file hasn't been deployed yet. Follow Issue 2 fix.

### Issue 4: Backend Endpoints Return 500 Errors
**Symptoms:** Debug script shows 500 errors
**Fix:** Check Render logs for database connection issues. Make sure:
- Database schema is applied
- Environment variables are set correctly

## After Running Debug Script

The debug script will show you:
- âœ… Database connection status
- âœ… Which tables exist and how many records
- âœ… Current backend version and available endpoints
- âœ… Test results for each endpoint your frontend uses

## Expected Results After Fix

When everything is working, you should see:
```
âœ… Database connected successfully!
ðŸ“‹ Tables found:
  - enhanced_users: X records
  - payment_transactions: X records  
  - questionnaire_responses: X records

âœ… Backend is responding
   Version: 2.0
   Legacy endpoints: 6
     - /api/auth/register
     - /api/working/register
     - /api/register
     - /api/enhanced-signup
     - /api/payments
     - /api/questionnaire

âœ… /api/auth/register - Status: 201
   Success: User registered successfully
```

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check Render logs** for your backend service
2. **Check browser console** on your frontend for CORS errors
3. **Verify frontend is sending requests** to the right endpoints
4. **Test manually** with curl:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://backend-topb.onrender.com/api/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"first_name":"Test","last_name":"User","email":"test@example.com"}'
   ```

Run the debug script now and let me know what it shows!
