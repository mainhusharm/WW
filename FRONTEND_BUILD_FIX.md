# 🚨 Frontend Build Fix for Render

## Problem
Frontend deployment is failing with error: `sh: 1: vite: not found`

## Root Cause
Render's static site build process sometimes doesn't properly install devDependencies, causing `vite` to not be found during the build.

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've moved the essential build dependencies to the main `dependencies` section:

### Dependencies Moved:
- `vite` (already was there)
- `@vitejs/plugin-react` (already was there)
- `autoprefixer` (moved from devDependencies)
- `postcss` (moved from devDependencies)
- `tailwindcss` (moved from devDependencies)
- `typescript` (moved from devDependencies)

### New Build Script Added:
- `build:static` - Ensures npm install runs before vite build

## 🔧 Fix Steps for Render

### Option 1: Update Build Command (Recommended)

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
2. **Find your frontend service** (`frontend-i6xs`)
3. **Click on the service name**
4. **Go to "Settings" tab**
5. **Update the Build Command to:**
   ```
   npm run build:static
   ```
6. **Click "Save Changes"**
7. **Go to "Manual Deploy" tab**
8. **Click "Deploy latest commit"**

### Option 2: Use Standard Build Command

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
2. **Find your frontend service** (`frontend-i6xs`)
3. **Click on the service name**
4. **Go to "Settings" tab**
5. **Update the Build Command to:**
   ```
   npm install && npm run build
   ```
6. **Click "Save Changes"**
7. **Go to "Manual Deploy" tab**
8. **Click "Deploy latest commit"**

### Option 3: Use Direct Vite Command

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
2. **Find your frontend service** (`frontend-i6xs`)
3. **Click on the service name**
4. **Go to "Settings" tab**
5. **Update the Build Command to:**
   ```
   npm install && npx vite build
   ```
6. **Click "Save Changes"**
7. **Go to "Manual Deploy" tab**
8. **Click "Deploy latest commit"**

## 🧪 Test After Fix

1. **Wait for deployment to complete** (3-5 minutes)
2. **Check build logs** for success message
3. **Visit your frontend URL:** `https://frontend-i6xs.onrender.com`
4. **Test the signup form:** `https://frontend-i6xs.onrender.com/signup-prisma`

## 📊 Expected Build Log Output

After the fix, you should see:
```
> trading-platform@1.0.0 build:static
> npm install && vite build

[build process continues...]
✓ built in Xms
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If still getting "vite: not found":
1. **Try Option 2** with explicit npm install
2. **Check if all dependencies are in package.json**
3. **Verify the build command is exactly as specified**

### If build succeeds but site doesn't load:
1. **Check Publish Directory** is set to `dist`
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Check if VITE_API_URL** points to your backend

### If getting TypeScript errors:
1. **Check if TypeScript is in dependencies** (it is now)
2. **Verify tsconfig.json** exists and is valid
3. **Check for any syntax errors** in the code

## 🎯 Final Result

After the fix:
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ Signup form loads at `/signup-prisma`
- ✅ Dashboard loads at `/customer-service-dashboard`
- ✅ All React components work properly
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling is applied

The frontend should now deploy successfully on Render! 🎉
